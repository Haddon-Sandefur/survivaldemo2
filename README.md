Hey there! I'm in the process of moving things over to github when previously relying on other methods for version control. I have some private repos I hope to make public soon.
In the meantime, feel free to check out this rmarkdown document I've published https://haddon-sandefur.github.io/survivaldemo2/
Thanks!!
